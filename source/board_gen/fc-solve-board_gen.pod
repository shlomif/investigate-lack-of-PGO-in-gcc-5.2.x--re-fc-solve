make-gnome-freecell-board, make-aisleriot-freecell-board,
pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board, make_pysol_freecell_board.py -
Programs to generate boards to be used as input to Freecell Solver.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<program> I<[-t]> I<board-number>

or for make_pysol_freecell_board.py:

B<program> I<[-t]> I<[-F]> I<board-number> [I<game-string>]

or for make-aisleriot-freecell-board:

B<program> I<[-t]> I<board-number> [I<game-string>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These programs are command-line programs that can generate the I<initial> board
of the Freecell games of several popular Solitaire implementations. Those boards
can be in turn be inputted to B<fc-solve> by means of a pipeline, or placed
inside a file for safe-keeping.

B<make_pysol_freecell_board.py> and B<make-aisleriot-freecell-board> also
accept an optional third argument which indicates the game type. This type
defaults to  Freecell, but is useful for generating the boards of other games.
Note that  using this flag does not preclude one from using the "--game"
flag of B<fc-solve>.

B<make_pysol_freecell_board.py> accepts another parameter called I<-F>
or I<--pysolfc> that deals the PySolFC boards instead of the classic PySol
ones.

A common paradigm for using those programs is something like:

    bash:~$ pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 11982 | fc-solve -l gi

If the "-t" option is specified, then the 10 cards are printed with "T"'s,
instead of "10"'s. While this does not have any effect on B<fc-solve> it
may prove useful for other solvers or solitaire implementations which do
not accept "10"'s.

Here is a short description of each program:

B<make-gnome-freecell-board>

Generate the boards of the standalone Freecell program that comes with the
GNOME desktop.

B<make-aisleriot-freecell-board>

Generate the Freecell boards of GNOME's AisleRiot.

B<make_pysol_freecell_board.py>

A Python script that generates the boards of the various games of PySol.

B<pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board>

A program that generates the boards of Microsoft Freecell and of the
Freecell Pro implementation of Freecell.
