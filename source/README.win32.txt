This package contains the Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME/XP/2003/Vista binaries of
Freecell Solver. Read the file "README" for usage and other
information.

The vanilla Freecell Solver program (included here) is a text-mode
program. If you want a nice graphical interface for it, then
download PySol-FC:

http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/

Or maybe Freecell Pro:

This version of Freecell Solver supports up to 8 freecells, 12
stacks and 11 initial cards per stack. If you'd like to increase
those settings, you'll need to recompile it. It was compiled with a
recursion stack size of 32 megabytes. (don't worry if you don't have
so much memory in your computer - it will still run fine)

Freecell Solver's homepage is at the following URL:

Enjoy!

Notes to Windows Users
----------------------

The fc-solve.exe executable is a command-line program. If you
double-click its icon it will just wait for keyboard input. To use
it, you need to feed it with a board file or an input of such. Read
the file README for instructions on how to construct the board file.

However, many times the programs in the board_gen directory can do the
job for you. For instance, the following command line feeds fc-solve
with initial board No. 24 of Microsoft Freecell:

-----------
.\board_gen\pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 24 | .\fc-solve
-----------

fc-solve accepts many options, and you may wish to consult the file
USAGE to learn more about it.

I am aware of several other implementations of Freecell for Windows
using different Freecell solvers. Links to them can be
found in the links section of the Freecell Solver homepage:
