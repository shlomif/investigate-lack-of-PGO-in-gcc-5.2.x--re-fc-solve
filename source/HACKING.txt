Benchmarking a Freecell Solver Release
--------------------------------------

Requirements: perl-5.8.x or above, CMake, gcc, bash and a working
pthreads-devel package.

1. Download the Freecell Solver .tar.bz2 archive from
http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ . Alternatively, use the git version control
system to clone the repository and get a working copy.

2. Create a new directory, cd there, unpack the archive and change the
directory from +freecell-solver-x.y.z+ to +source+. Alternatively, you can
use a different path here.

3. Run +../source/Tatzer -l fc_bench+ (for a Freecell-only capable solver)
or +../source/Tatzer -l bench+ (for a solver that can solve all supported
games). Also append these options:
+
    a. +--max-bench-threads-num=4+ , where 4 is the maximal
    number of threads you'd like to run which is a function of the number of
    processors/cores your computer has.
+
    b. +--prefix=$HOME/opt/fc-solve+ for setting the installation prefix to
    install to.

4. Type +make+ to build everything.

5. Type +make install+.

6. Type +bash pgo.bash+ to prepare a GCC Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO)
executable.

7. Then you can run a shell script like this one:
+
--------------------------------------
num_threads=4 ; for t in $(seq 1 8) ; do sudo_renice bash -c "ARGS='--worker-step 16 -l as' bash ../source/scripts/time-threads-num.bash $num_threads $num_threads" ; done
--------------------------------------
+
Where sudo_renice is something like:
+
https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/src/c8189d118c1f68c24a99c916c3fdd48275aeb0fd/shlomif-settings/home-bin-executables/bin/sudo_renice?at=default

8. To see the results, you can use +perl ../source/scripts/time-fcs.pl
DUMPS-*/*+ and copy-and-paste the results to the Freecell Solver developers
with specifications of your computer that are as detailed as possible.

Getting the test suite up and running
-------------------------------------

These are instruction how to get the test suite up and running:

1. Install the dependencies: Subversion, CMake (2.6.3 or later only), make,
gcc, g\++, valgrind, perl5 (at least perl-5.8.9, perl-5.10.0 or above is
recommended),
+
+
* On Debian:
+
--------------------
apt-get install subversion cmake make gcc g++ valgrind perl
--------------------
+
* On Mandriva/Mageia:
+
-------------------
urpmi subversion cmake make gcc g++ valgrind perl perl-devel
-------------------

2. Install the dependencies of the test suite:
+
* Download +local::lib+ from http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/
and follow the instructions to set it up.
+
* Restart bash (no need to restart the computer, just open a new terminal
window).
+
----------
export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1
perl -Mlocal::lib -MCPAN -e 'install Task::FreecellSolver::Testing'
----------

3. Install the development headers of
libtap ( http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap ).
+
* On Mandriva:
+
    # urpmi libtap-devel
+
* On Debian:
+
-------------------------------
tar -xvf /home/shlomif/Desktop/tap-1.01.tar.gz
cd tap-1.01
./configure --prefix="$HOME/apps/libtap"
make CFLAGS+=-UHAVE_LIBPTHREAD
make install
# For gcc finding tap.h in the includes
echo 'export CPATH="$HOME/apps/libtap/include:$CPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# For CMake finding libtap.
echo 'export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/apps/libtap:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
------------------------------

4. Check out the latest Freecell Solver sources:
+
-------------------
git clone https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/fc-solve
-------------------
+
(You can also use http://bundler.caurea.org/ ).

5. +$ cd fc-solve/fc-solve/source/+

6. +$ mkdir build ; cd build$

7. Configure the Freecell Solver build
+
	$ ../Tatzer

8. Build Freecell Solver:
+
	$ make

9. Test Freecell Solver:
+
	$ make test

Style Guidelines
----------------

Freecell Solver uses its own style (largely based on the Allman style:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style ),
based on the preferences of its primary author (Shlomi Fish). Some guidelines
for the style will be given here.

4 Spaces for Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Freecell Solver source code should be kept free of horizontal
tabs (\t, HT, \x09) and use spaces alone. Furthermore, there should be
a 4 wide space indentation inside blocks:

----------------
if (COND())
{
    int i;

    printf("%s\n", "COND() is successful!");

    for (i=0 ; i < 10 ; i++)
    {
        ...
    }
}
----------------

Curly Braces Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The opening curly brace of an if-statement or a for-statement should be
placed below the statement on the same level as the other line, and the
inner block indented by 4 spaces. A good example can be found in the previous
section. Here are some bad examples:

----------------
if ( COND() ) {
    /* Bad because the opening brace is on the same line.
}
----------------

----------------
if ( COND() )
    {
    /* Bad because the left and right braces are indented along with
    the block. */
    printf(....)
    }
----------------

----------------
/* GNU Style - fear and loathing. */
if ( COND() )
  {
    printf(....)
  }
----------------

Comments should precede the lines performing the action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comments should come one line before the line that they explain:

----------------
/* Check if it can be moved to something on the same stack */
for(dc=0;dc<c-1;dc++)
{
    .
    .
    .
}
----------------

+TODO: Fill in+

One line clauses should be avoided
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One should avoid one-line clauses inside the clauses of +if+, +else+,
+elsif+, +while+, etc. Instead one should wrap the single statements inside
blocks. This is to avoid common errors with extraneous semicolons:

----------------
/* Bad: */
if (COND())
    printf ("%s\n", "Success!");

/* Good: */
if (COND())
{
    printf ("%s\n", "Success!");
}

/* Bad: */
while (COND())
    printf("%s\n", "I'm still running.");

/* Good: */
while (COND())
{
    printf("%s\n", "I'm still running.");
}
----------------

Identifier Naming Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some naming conventions for identifiers:

1. Please do not use capital letters (including not +CamelCase+) - use
all lowercase letters with words separated by underscores. Remember, C is
case sensitive.

2. Note, however, that comments should be phrased in proper English, with
proper Capitalization and distinction between uppercase and lowercase
letters. So should the rest of the Freecell Solver internal and external
documentation.

3. Some commonly used abbreviations:

----------------
max - maximum
num - numbers
cols - columns
dest - destination
src - source
ds - dest stack
stack - usually the source stack
ptr - pointer
val - value
c - the card index/position within the column
befs - Best First Search (one of the types of searches used by Freecell Solver)
a_star - also refers to "befs" from historical reasons (should be converted
to "befs" in the non-external interface.)
dfs - Depth-First Search (one of the types of searches used by Freecell Solver)
----------------

Don't comment-out - use #if 0 to temporarily remove code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code should not be commented-out using gigantic +/* ... */+ comments. Instead,
it should be out-blocked using +#if 0...#endif+.

In Perl code, one can use the following POD paradigm to remove a block of
code:

----------------
=begin Removed

Removed code here.

=end Removed

=cut
----------------
