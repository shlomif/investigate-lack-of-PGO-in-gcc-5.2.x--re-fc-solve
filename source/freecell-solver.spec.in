%description
The Freecell Solver package contains the fc-solve executable which is
a command-line program that can be used to solve games of Freecell and
similar card solitaire variants.

This package also contains command line executables to generate the initial
boards of several popular Freecell implementations.

%description -n libfreecell-solver0-devel
Freecell Solver is a library for automatically solving boards of Freecell and
similar variants of card Solitaire. This package contains the header files and
static libraries necessary for developing programs using Freecell Solver.

You should install it if you are a game developer who would like to use
Freecell Solver from within your programs.
