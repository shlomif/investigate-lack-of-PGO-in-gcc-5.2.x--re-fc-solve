Freecell Solver's Authors and Contributors List
-----------------------------------------------

* *Shlomi Fish* ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) - doing most of the work on
Freecell Solver.

* *Eric Warmenhoven* - sending a program that generates the board of GNOME
Freecell.

* *Hai Huang* - noting several boards of Microsoft Freecell that could not be
solved by Freecell Solver.

* *Magnus Reftel* - noting the correct procedure for calculating how many
cards can be moved as a function of the free freecells and free stacks.

* *Colin Plumb* - writing the MD5 code.

* *Ron Rivest* - inventing the MD5 hashing algorithm.

* *Jim Horne* - supplying the shuffling algorithm for
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro.

* *Tom Holroyd* - sending several Seahaven Towers games which Freecell Solver
was unable to solve, thus making me improve the algorithm.

* *Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer* - writing PySol, on whose code I based the board
generation program for it. He also contributed some patches.

* *Justin-Heyes Jones* - wrote a nice introduction to the A* algorithm, and
wrote the basis for the pqueue.c code.

* *Stephan Kulow* - integrated Freecell Solver into the kpat Solitaire suite for
KDE 2.1 and onwards; reported several bugs and memory leaks.

* *Michael Keller* - Contributing some useful input about some minor features
lacking and the Spades/Clubs mix-up.

* *GeYong* - He created Freecell Tool, whose randomized scan provided
inspiration for the random-DFS scan of Freecell Solver.

* *Adrian Ettlinger* - Integrating Freecell Solver into "Freecell Pro", and
contributing some input.

* *The perl 5.x Hackers* - I copied its hash function.

* *Gergeley Kontra* - wrote a Vim script to align text which I used.

* *Bob Jenkins* - wrote the lookup2 hash function, which was used as
the primary hash until reverted back to the perl 5.x hash.
(check http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/)

* *Tzafrir Cohen* - His "RPM" lecture provided help in creating the RPM
+.spec+ file and constructing RPMs (RPM Package Manager) for Freecell
Solver.

* *Yotam Rubin* - Preparing an initial Debian Package.

* *Risko Gergely* - Maintaining the current Debian Package and contributing
some patches to the CMake build system.

* *Chris Moore* - Pointing to an out-of-date comment regarding the
+MAX_NUM_CARDS_IN_A_STACK+ which I updated.

* *Anonymous* (on http://xrl.us/h6ex ) - for pointing out the malloc.h and
leading double underscores problems.

* *Con Radchenko* - supplying a small patch, and reporting a bug with
+--method dfs+, and supplying some other input. Integrated Freecell Solver
into http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ .

* *larrysan45* - reporting a problem with +--sequence-move unlimited+
and +--empty-stacks-filled-by kings+, which resulted in a bug fix.

* *Ido Kanner* ( http://ik.homelinux.org/ ) - reporting a segfault when running
freecell-solver-2.28.0 on x86-64, and allowing us to diagnose it.

* *Gary Campbell* ( http://numin8r.us/ ) - participating in the mailing list
and inspiring some past (and possibly future) work on optimising the
length of the resultant solutions. He was given the honour of naming the
"sand-stone" and "slick-rock" "-l" presets. Has his own solver for
Freecell for DOS on his homepage.

* *LECA Dimitri (Pythack)* ( http://pythack.com/ ) - tried to run the
Freecell Solver test suite and benchmarks on Archlinux, reported some
problems in the process. This in turn eventually made us simplify the process
and also uncovered some bugs in the dependencies.

that we use on the download page], which is under the Creative Commons
Attribution ShareAlike licence. Thanks!

* *David Stevenson* - inspiring a documentation clarification for broken
versions of CMake (e.g: cmake-2.6.2).

* *Jurij Bortnik* ( http://freecellgamesolutions.com/ ) - reported some broken
links on the Freecell Solver homepage.

* *Kaz Kylheku* ( http://www.kylheku.com/~kaz/ ) - author and originator of
kazlib ( http://www.kylheku.com/~kaz/kazlib.html ) whose BSDLed balanced binary
search tree is included in the Freecell Solver distribution.

* *Don Woods* ( http://www.icynic.com/~don/ ) - wrote an early Freecell
solver ( http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/don_woods.html ), whose source code
inspired the early “delta states” algorithm, which is currently used by the
dbm_fc_solver.

* *Michiel de Bondt* ( http://www.math.ru.nl/~debondt/ ) - suggested a
way to improve the delta states algorithm, so states will be stored more
compactly. Currently implemented in the dbm_fc_solver. See
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/1115 .

* *Alon Zakai* ( http://github.com/kripken ) - maintainer of
https://github.com/kripken/emscripten[emscripten], which allows to convert
LLVM bitcode (and ergo code in C, C++ and other languages) into JavaScript.
Inspired some changes to make Freecell Solver’s build-process more
user-friendly and idiot-proof.

* *Olaf van der Kruk* - reported an issue with using the online
JavaScript-based solver (which is mostly translated from the C source using
emscripten), which uncovered several bugs.

* *The Mayhem Team* - ( Alexandre Rebert, Thanassis Avgerinos, Sang Kil Cha,
David Brumley, and Manuel Egele from Cylab at Carnegie Mellon University ) for
reporting some failures of Freecell Solver executables to handle
malformed input in the Debian Bug Tracker, e.g:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=715914 with
steps to reproduce.
