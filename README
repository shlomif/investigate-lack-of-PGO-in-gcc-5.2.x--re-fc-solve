1. Make sure gcc, GNU make , etc. are in the path (a GNU/Linux system is
preferable).

2. cd to the source/ directory and type "bash RUN_PGO.bash" . This will
build everything.

3. Type "bash RUN_ME_TO_TIME.bash" to time the results.

Here (= Mageia Linux x86-64 6/Cauldron) the gcc-4.9.x results are faster than
those of the ones with gcc-5.2.1-0.20150811.4.mga6 .
